In this activity, I learned about internet security protocols and email phishing. Internet security protocols like IPSec and SSL are crucial for securing data transmission. 
      IPSec works at the IP layer to provide confidentiality and authentication, while SSL secures communication at the transport layer, ensuring privacy, integrity, and authentication. 
      I also learned about the risks of email phishing, where cybercriminals use fake emails to steal sensitive information like usernames and passwords. 
      Common signs of phishing emails include poor grammar, suspicious links, and threats.
I can apply this knowledge by implementing secure protocols like IPSec and SSL in a network or website environment to protect sensitive data. Additionally,
      I can use my understanding of phishing to educate others on how to recognize phishing attempts and protect themselves from such attacks. This will be valuable in both personal and professional settings, especially in cybersecurity roles where securing communication and data is essential.

In this activity, I explored privacy settings in Internet Explorer and compared them to features in browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Internet Explorer offers options like cookie management, Do Not Track, InPrivate Browsing, and location sharing controls. 
      It also allows users to block pop-ups and prevent third-party tracking. Chrome and Firefox offer similar features such as Incognito Mode and Private Browsing, with enhanced tracking protection in Firefox by default.
I learned how these settings help protect user privacy by reducing tracking and securing personal data. I can apply this knowledge by using these features to protect my own data and by advising others on best practices for online privacy. In future cybersecurity roles, 
      Iâ€™ll be able to implement and recommend these settings to enhance digital security.</p>
