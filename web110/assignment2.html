Web browsers are software applications used to explore and interact with information on the internet. 
By entering a URL in the address bar, users can access various content types like text, audio, video, and animations. Web browsers interpret commands from web pages and present them in a user-friendly format.
In this activity, I learned about the basic components of web browsers, including the controller, interpreter, and client programs, as well as features like saving web pages, adding favorites, and organizing them.
I can apply this knowledge to efficiently navigate the internet, manage frequently visited websites, and use browser tools to save and organize information for both personal and professional purposes.</p>

Browser extensions are tools that enhance browser functionality, such as blocking ads or adding shortcuts. However, unwanted or unnecessary extensions can be removed or disabled.
In this activity, I learned step-by-step processes to manage extensions across major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera. This includes disabling extensions using toggle switches and permanently removing them via menu options.
I can apply this knowledge to streamline my browsing experience, improve browser performance, and address security concerns by removing extensions I no longer need or trust. This will be especially useful in managing productivity tools or troubleshooting browser issues in my current or future personal and professional digital environment.</p>
