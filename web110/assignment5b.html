The activity on piracy helped me understand the importance of copyright laws, especially regarding music. Piracy involves the illegal copying and sharing of music, 
      such as downloading unauthorized songs from file-sharing sites or using apps to steal audio from videos. Copyright laws protect the rights of creators, and violating them can result in severe consequences 
      like fines or jail time. I learned that while technology makes copying music easy, it’s essential to know the difference between legal and illegal practices. 
      It’s fine to download music from authorized sites or make personal copies for private use, but sharing or distributing unauthorized copies is illegal. 
      This knowledge is important for my future, as I can ensure I respect copyright laws when enjoying or sharing music. 
      In my professional life, whether in media or marketing, I will promote legal ways to access and distribute music, helping maintain a fair digital environment and help the creator earn the money they deserve</p>
